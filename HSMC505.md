   - Specialization allows employees to become experts in specific tasks, improving efficiency and productivity.  
   - Example: In a manufacturing plant, workers are assigned to specific tasks on an assembly line.  

2. **Authority and Responsibility**  
   - Managers must have the authority to give orders and ensure compliance, while also being responsible for the results.
