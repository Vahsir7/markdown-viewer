## **Demographic Profile: Characteristics of Indian Population**

### 1. **Characteristics of Indian Population**

- **Age Structure**  
  - India has a young population, with a significant proportion under 15 years (about 25-30%) and a large working-age population (15-59 years) around 60-68%[2][6][17].  
  - Example: In 2023, 25% of the population was aged 0-14, 68% were 15-64, and about 7% were above 65 years[6].  
  - This youthful population is termed a "demographic dividend," offering economic growth potential if properly harnessed.

- **Sex Ratio**  
  - Sex ratio is the number of females per 1000 males. India’s sex ratio has been historically skewed towards males due to cultural preferences, female infanticide, and selective abortions.  
  - Example: As per the 2011 Census, India’s sex ratio was 943 females per 1000 males; Kerala had the highest (1084), Haryana the lowest (879)[7][13].  
  - This imbalance affects marriage patterns and social dynamics.

- **Religion**  
  - India is religiously diverse with Hindus (about 80%), Muslims (14%), Christians (2-3%), Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and others[8].  
  - The religious composition has remained relatively stable since Partition, with slight growth in Muslim population share and decline in Hindu share.  
  - Example: Muslims grew from about 9.8% in 1951 to 14.2% in 2011[8].

- **Language**  
  - India is linguistically diverse with 22 scheduled languages and hundreds of dialects. Hindi is the most widely spoken language, followed by Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, etc.[9].  
  - Example: According to the 2011 Census, 26% of Indians are bilingual and 7% trilingual, reflecting linguistic diversity[9].

- **Occupations**  
  - Indian occupations range across agriculture, manufacturing, services, and informal sectors. Agriculture remains a major occupation, but there is a growing workforce in industry and services[10].  
  - Example: Occupations include agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, construction, health services, and many more as per the official list of 127 occupations[10].

---

## **Population Growth**

- India’s population has grown rapidly, especially between 1951 and 1981, when it nearly doubled from 360 million to 700 million[4][5].  
- Causes include high birth rates, declining death rates due to medical advances, illiteracy, poverty, and early marriage[4].  
- The growth rate has slowed since the 1980s due to family planning and socio-economic changes but remains significant[5][20].  
- Example: India’s population crossed 1.4 billion by 2023, overtaking China as the most populous country[16][20].

---

## **Age**

- Age composition divides population into children (0-14 years), working-age (15-59 years), and elderly (60+ years).  
- India has a large young population, which can be a demographic dividend if employed well, but also poses challenges in education and employment[2][6][17].  
- Example: The median age in India is about 29 years, much younger than developed countries like Japan (49.5 years)[6][13].

---

## **Sex**

- The sex ratio reflects gender balance. India has a skewed sex ratio favoring males, influenced by social factors like son preference and gender discrimination[7][13].  
- Efforts are ongoing to improve the ratio through laws and awareness campaigns.

---

## **Religion**

- India’s population is religiously pluralistic with Hinduism as the majority religion, followed by Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism[8].  
- Religious groups are regionally concentrated, e.g., Sikhs in Punjab, Muslims in Jammu & Kashmir, Christians in Kerala and Northeast[8].

---

## **Language**

- India is home to hundreds of languages grouped mainly into Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Sino-Tibetan families[9][13].  
- Hindi is the most widely spoken language, but many states have their own official languages.  
- Example: Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, and Urdu are also widely spoken[9].

---

## **Occupations**

- India’s workforce is diverse, with a large share in agriculture, but also significant numbers in manufacturing, services, and informal sectors[10].  
- Examples of occupations include farming, animal husbandry, weaving, carpentry, healthcare, teaching, and many small-scale industries[10].

---

## **National Policy on Population**

- The **National Population Policy (NPP), 2000** aims to stabilize India’s population by 2045 through improving healthcare, family planning, and education[11][18].  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Immediate: Address unmet contraception and healthcare needs.  
  - Medium-term: Reduce Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to replacement level (2.1) by 2010.  
  - Long-term: Achieve stable population consistent with sustainable development by 2045[11][18].

- **Key features:**  
  - Promote voluntary family planning and reproductive health services.  
  - Make education free and compulsory up to age 14.  
  - Reduce infant and maternal mortality rates.  
  - Encourage delayed marriage and smaller family norms.  
  - Integrate traditional medicine systems and improve immunization coverage[11][12][18].

- Example: Kerala’s success in reducing population growth through education, healthcare, and social reforms aligns with NPP goals[15].

## Unit-V: Introduction to Human Behaviour

---

### **Overview of Human Behaviour**

- **Definition:**  
  - Human behaviour refers to the range of actions, reactions, and interactions exhibited by individuals, influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors[2][6][8].
  - It includes everything from physical actions (walking, talking) to mental processes (thinking, remembering) and emotional responses (happiness, anger)[2][8].

- **Components:**  
  - **Actions:** Observable behaviours like eating, speaking, or playing sports[8].
  - **Cognitions:** Internal processes such as thoughts, beliefs, and decision-making[8].
  - **Emotions:** Feelings and affective states, e.g., joy, sadness, fear[8].

- **Types of Behaviour:**  
  - **Molecular vs. Moral:**  
    - *Molecular*: Sudden, instinctive actions (e.g., blinking when dust enters the eye)[5].  
    - *Moral*: Thoughtful, deliberate actions (e.g., responding to an accusation after consideration)[5].
  - **Overt vs. Covert:**  
    - *Overt*: Visible actions (e.g., running, eating)[5].  
    - *Covert*: Hidden, internal actions (e.g., thinking, imagining)[5].
  - **Voluntary vs. Involuntary:**  
    - *Voluntary*: Actions under conscious control (e.g., writing, speaking)[5].  
    - *Involuntary*: Automatic actions (e.g., breathing, heartbeat)[5].

- **Example:**  
  - Deciding to help a friend (moral, voluntary, overt), feeling nervous before an exam (covert, involuntary), or reflexively withdrawing your hand from a hot surface (molecular, involuntary).

---

### **Importance of Studying Human Behaviour**

- **Personal Growth:**  
  - Enhances self-awareness, enabling better self-control and personal development[7].
  - Example: Recognizing stress triggers helps manage anxiety.

- **Interpersonal Relationships:**  
  - Improves empathy and communication, leading to healthier relationships[7].
  - Example: Understanding body language can help resolve conflicts.

- **Professional Applications:**  
  - Essential in fields like psychology, education, management, marketing, and healthcare[7][8].
  - Example: Teachers use behavioural insights to adapt teaching methods for different students.

- **Societal Benefits:**  
  - Helps address social issues (e.g., crime, addiction), inform policy, and improve public health[3][8].
  - Example: Behavioural studies guide campaigns to reduce smoking or promote vaccination.

- **Therapeutic Interventions:**  
  - Informs treatment of mental health and behavioural disorders (e.g., autism, substance abuse)[3].
  - Example: Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) is used to teach skills to children with autism.

---

### **Determinants of Human Behaviour**

- **Biological Factors:**  
  - Genetics, brain chemistry, hormones, and physiology influence behaviour[6].
  - Example: Genetic predisposition to anxiety or aggression; serotonin levels affecting mood.

- **Psychological Factors:**  
  - Thoughts, emotions, perceptions, personality traits, and past experiences[6][8].
  - Example: A person with a positive self-image is more likely to take on leadership roles.

- **Sociocultural Factors:**

  - Example: In some cultures, direct eye contact is respectful; in others, it may be seen as rude.

- **Environmental Factors:**  
  - Physical surroundings, climate, and living conditions[4].
  - Example: Growing up in a violent neighborhood may lead to more aggressive behaviour.

- **Social Learning:**  
  - Observing and imitating others, receiving feedback, and modeling behaviour[4].
  - Example: A child learns to say “thank you” by watching parents.

- **Personal Experiences:**  
  - Life events, trauma, relationships, and transitions[4].
  - Example: Surviving a natural disaster may make someone more cautious and risk-averse.

---

### **Examples Illustrating Determinants**

- **Biological:**  
  - Identical twins raised apart showing similar habits due to genetics[6].
- **Psychological:**  
  - A student’s fear of public speaking rooted in a past embarrassing incident.
- **Sociocultural:**  
  - Dietary habits shaped by religious beliefs (e.g., vegetarianism in Hinduism).
